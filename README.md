# sql_practice
In these files I learned how to communicate with a basic sql database using
python3's sqlalchemy toolkit also refered to as an sql expression language

# learning?
If you happen to stumble upon this repository and are looking to learn how
to talk to an sql database using python3 or to learn about sql in general,
playing with these scripts and a local sqlite databse is great introduction
and simply put most things you can do with an sqlite database can translate 
over to an postgresql database the base diffence between them is that in 
postgresql and other cloud db the character limit/length of a table column
must be specified during table object creation

# Warning 
Running either of the scripts in this repository on your local machine
will create an sqlite database in the same directory as the scripts.
